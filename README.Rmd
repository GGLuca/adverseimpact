# advserseimpact

# Goal

The goal of advserseimpact is to compute a number of important statistical indicators of adverse impact in selection decisions.

The package computes a total of 6 indicators in 2 large categories:

1) statistical significance measures: the Z-test, and the LMP (Lancaster's Mid-P) test, and

2) practical significance measures: the h-statistic, the Phi-coefficient, the SF (ShortFall) statistic, and the impact ratio.

Input in the function is the 2x2 minority-majority selection matrix, containing 4 values: NPmin (number of participants passing the selection procedure from the minority group), NPmaj (number of participants passing the selection procedure from the majority group), NFmin (number of participants failing the selection procedure from the minority group), NFmaj (number of participants failing the selection procedure from the majority group).

## Installation

You can install the development version of advserseimpact from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GGLuca/adverseimpact")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(advserseimpact)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
