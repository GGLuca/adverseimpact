\title{Fisher's Exact Test (FET) for Selection Procedure Outcomes}
\usage{
ai_fisher(NFmin, NPmin, NFmaj, NPmaj)
}
\arguments{
\item{NFmin}{Number of participants failing the selection procedure from the minority group}

\item{NPmin}{Number of participants passing the selection procedure from the minority group}

\item{NFmaj}{Number of participants failing the selection procedure from the majority group}

\item{NPmaj}{Number of participants passing the selection procedure from the majority group}
}
\value{
A list containing the Fisher's Exact Test results (p-value and odds ratio).
}
\description{
This function calculates Fisher's Exact Test (FET) for a 2x2 contingency table representing selection procedure outcomes
for minority and majority groups. It helps to assess the statistical significance of the association between group membership
and selection outcomes.
}
\examples{
# Example data
NFmin <- 10 # Number of participants failing the selection procedure from the minority group
NPmin <- 5  # Number of participants passing the selection procedure from the minority group
NFmaj <- 30 # Number of participants failing the selection procedure from the majority group
NPmaj <- 15 # Number of participants passing the selection procedure from the majority group

# Calculate Fisher's Exact Test results
result <- ai_fisher(NFmin, NPmin, NFmaj, NPmaj)
