Description: This R package provides a suite of functions for assessing adverse impact in employee selection and hiring procedures. Adverse impact occurs when a selection procedure disproportionately excludes members of a protected class, such as race or gender. The package includes functions to compute statistical tests, such as the Z-test and LMP test, as well as practical measures, like the h-statistic, Phi-coefficient, and adjusted shortfall. By offering a comprehensive set of tools, this package helps organizations evaluate their selection procedures and make data-driven decisions to minimize adverse impact and promote fairness in the hiring process.
